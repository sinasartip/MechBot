## Description

This project utilizises the 2 front I.R distance sensors to know what is in front. The bot utilizes a wall-follower algorith to find its way out. 

The control system has a prefered direction and will turn whenever the front of the bot is blocked. 

The bot also follows a black line to find its way to the maze entrance.
